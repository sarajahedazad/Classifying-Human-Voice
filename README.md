# Classifying Human Voices
In this project, I tried to classify human voices based on their genders and emotions.

## Dataset
This was a class project and every one in the class contributed in gathering the data. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to share the dataset online.
However, I can provide some details about the dataset I used. Eeach one of us had to record 10 different sentences with 4 different emotions for at least 4 differnt people.

Sentences: (The original sentences are in Persian, I have translated them below)
1. Hello to you. 2. Thank you. 3. You worked hard. 4. I became very happy. 5. It is obvious. 6. You are right. 7. How are you. 8. It is kind of you. 9. Definitely so. 10. That is really great.

Emotions: 1. Anger 2. Joy 3. Sadness 4. Neutral

* Audio Files: they are name
* Excel: details about each audio file is provided in an excel file. The columns are named like this: emotionID, textID
